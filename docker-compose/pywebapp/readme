This is a web development project using the Python Django framework, with a Postgres database as the backend service.

The main goal is that when you visit the project app URL in browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Safari. 
It will display the 'default' page along with some of the records from the tables we created using the entrypoint method in the docker-compose.yaml file.

http://localhost:5000/

docker-compose up        //It is used to start and run all the services defined in a docker-compose.yml file
